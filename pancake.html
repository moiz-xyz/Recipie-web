    <h1>Pan Cake Recipie </h1>
    <p>
        Pancakes are a popular breakfast dish enjoyed worldwide. They are made from a batter consisting of flour, eggs, milk (or buttermilk), and butter, which is cooked on a hot surface such as a griddle or frying pan. The batter spreads out and cooks until bubbles form on the surface, signaling it's time to flip it over to cook the other side.

    <h2>Ingrediants</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
          <li> 1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
<li>2 tablespoons sugar (optional, for sweetness)</li>
 <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
 <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1 cup milk (you can use buttermilk for a tangier flavor)</li>
<li>1 large egg</li>
 <li>2 tablespoons melted butter or vegetable oil</li>
<li> teaspoon vanilla extract (optional, for flavor)</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>
        <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Batter:</li>

        In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar (if using), baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
        <li>Mix Wet Ingredients:</li>
        
       <li> In another bowl, whisk together the milk, egg, melted butter or oil, and vanilla extract</li>
       <li> Combine:<br>
        Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. Mix gently until just combined. It's okay if the batter is a bit lumpy; overmixing can make the pancakes tough.
        Cooking:</li>
        
       <li> Heat a non-stick griddle or frying pan over medium heat. Lightly grease with butter or oil.</li>
        <li>Pour about 1/4 cup of batter onto the griddle for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on the surface and the edges look set, about 2-3 minutes.</li>
       <li>Flip the pancake and cook until the other side is golden brown, about 1-2 minutes more</li>.
        <b>Serve:</b>      
        Serve pancakes warm with your favorite toppings such as maple syrup, fresh fruits, whipped cream, or chocolate sauce.
        Enjoy your homemade pancakes!
