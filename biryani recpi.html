        <ol>
        
      <li> Marinate the Chicken:</li>

<li>In a large bowl, mix together the yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, chili powder, turmeric powder, garam masala, and salt.
Add the chicken pieces to the marinade and coat them well. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, preferably longer (up to overnight).
Prepare the Rice:</li>
<br>
<li>In a large pot, bring 4 cups of water to a boil.
Add the soaked and drained rice, bay leaf, cloves, cardamom pods, and salt.
Cook the rice until it is 70-80% done (parboiled). The grains should still be firm. Drain the rice and set aside.
Fry the Onions:</li>

Add the thinly sliced onions and fry until they are golden brown and crispy. Remove half of the fried onions and set aside for garnish.

Sprinkle half of the chopped coriander leaves and mint leaves over the chicken.
Layer half of the parboiled rice evenly over the chicken and herbs</li>
<br>
<li>Repeat the layers: chicken, coriander leaves, mint leaves, and rice.</li>

If using saffron milk, drizzle it over the top layer of rice.
Cover the pan with a tight-fitting lid or aluminum foil to trap the steam.

Once the biryani is cooked, gently fluff the rice with a fork.
Garnish with the reserved fried onions.
